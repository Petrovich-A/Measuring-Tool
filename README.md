## Instrument Control System (ICS)

The Instrument Control System is a Java-based project aimed at managing and tracking measurement tools in warehouse facilities at a large-scale engineering enterprise. Upon registration and login to the portal, the warehouse manager gains the ability to register measurement tools based on their type, lab number, and other parameters. Furthermore, the manager can issue tools to enterprise employees, registering the issuance via the application. Additionally, the system is designed to send notifications to employees requiring them to submit the tools for inspection a specific time before the scheduled verification date, ensuring timely maintenance and quality control of the instruments.

### Key Features
- User authentication
- Tool registration and details tracking
- Issuance registration and tracking
- Automated notification system for inspection reminders

The project aims to streamline and enhance the management and periodic maintenance of measurement tools within the organization, contributing to efficient operational practices and quality assurance.
